# The Lost World

**When** you open your eyes, the world is no longer as you knew it.  
**It** is very mysterious, ruins everywhere, countless legends and secrets mixed in the distant wanders of the song.  
**Ah!**  
**You**, stranger from a strange land!  
**The** world is full of secrets and history is buried in dust!
**Do** you choose to muddle through, or explore the unknown?  
**The choice is in your own hands.**
